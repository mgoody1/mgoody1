                    <h3>The channel</h3>
                    <p>This channel primarily started as a gaming channel on youtube. That is where my passion was, but trying
                        to make it as another gaming channel on YouTube isn't the easiest thing to do. Once I got my first 
                        gaming PC, I decided to try other things. That is where, I guess you could say, my channel focus
                        on reviewing my PC for various games, or options that people were curious about. Since this PC is 
                        more on the "budget" end for a gaming PC, plenty of people were thinking about getting it, they just
                        wanted to make sure it was right for them. That's when the channel started to take off.</p>

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>You see I, like many others, always dreamed about making it as one of those famous content creators
                        on the platform. Something about that lifestyle was always so appealing to me. It wasn't even 
                        the money that appealed to me most, more the popularity, and basically being my own boss. Being able 
                        to lead my own future to where I wanted to go has always been a dream of mine. That and I've always
                        used YouTube videos as my "escape" on days or times when I just needed that break from reality. There 
                        were always the same creators that I would watch to achieve this goal, and if I could be that escape
                        for even one person, what an awesome feeling that would be. However like I stated, growing as a 
                        gaming channel on YouTube is a struggle all too real. Once that transitioned over though, my 
                        subscriber count start growing and a rapid pace for my channel. In January of 2021 I had a count 
                        of 17 subscribers on my channel. By the end of March that number had grown to over 400, and averaging
                        over 20 watch hours per day. Wow that feeling of growth, and all the positive feedback was an 
                        amazing feeling.</p>

                    <h3>The Slowdown</h3>
                    <p>So my channel was growing rapidly for my size, great thing right? Well behind the scenes I was 
                        trying to start something to change my life in more probable ways. You see, as big of a dream
                        as that "YouTube" career was for me, even with seeing this bit of hope, it's still a longshot.
                        That combined with my approaching age 30 in the coming months, I wanted to start something 
                        that had much better odds and changing my life. A line that Markiplier used during the ending 
                        livestream for Unus Annus, "You can dedicate your life to something for a year, and change your
                        life forever", really stuck with me. So in comes Lambda. At Lambda School I could take a year
                        to learn full stack web development, and change my life forever.</p>
